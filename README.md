# BikeShops

Greetings, and welcome to Brody's Bike Shops! This comprehensive CLI app will help you determine the best bike shops to visit using the location you provide. The data is derived from Yelp's own API, so you can rest assured that you will be viewing the top merchants along with contact info, reviews, and ratings!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bike_shops'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bike_shops

## Usage

The CLI will ask you for your location. You may enter zip codes, cities, or states, and the app will return a list of shops using a Yelp API. The list will automatically be displayed as the top 20 rated and reviewed shops in the given area. Be sure follow the prompts to navigate through the app. Cheers!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
